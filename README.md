# PV_detection
Detect the PV pannels in images with dimension 5000*5000

The images dataset is produced by Dr. Kyle Bradbury of Duke University. This dataset consists of the csv files which store the geospatial coordinates and the bounders of PV vertices and satellite image files. More details can be found in the paper "Distributed solar photovoltaic array location and extent dataset for remote sensing object identification".
